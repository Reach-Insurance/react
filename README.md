# Insurance Dapp
This is an Insurance Decentralized Application (Dapp) developed in reach. 

## Idea
It's a community owned insurance platform, where every member is both an insurer and a policy holder (client) at the same time. When a member faces any disaster such as loss/damage of property, loss of a relative, sickness, or any other situation that calls for emmergency help, they can submit a claim for funding to the decentralized application which is communally owned. All that is required for the member to be funded is approval of atleast 5 members of the same community, who then act as the witnesses of the reported incidence. Upon receiving the claim, the Dapp notifies every member of the community, prompting anyone of them to voluntarilly approve the claim in case they are aware of it and hence they can act as witnesses. If the Dapp receives atleast 5 approvals, then the requested amount of money will be taken off the treasury account and transfered to the account of the claimant. However, the amount that can be given to the claimant cannot exceed their funding limit. The funding limit depends on how much monthly fee the member pays.

## Source of funds
Every member pays a monthly subscription fee to the Dapp for the insurance security the same way they would do to a traditional insurance company. They can also pay for their dependants such as children. The more monthly fee a member pays, the higher their funding limit.
